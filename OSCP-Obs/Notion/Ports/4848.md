Port **4848/tcp** is most commonly associated with the **administration console of GlassFish Server** (an open-source Java EE / Jakarta EE application server).

- **GlassFish Admin Console**:
    
    - Default web-based admin interface runs on port **4848**.
        
    - Accessible via `http://<server-ip>:4848/`
        
    - Used to manage domains, deploy applications, configure resources, and monitor performance.
        

Other, less common uses:

- Some custom applications may also bind to **4848** for admin/debugging purposes.
    
- It is **not a standardized IANA-assigned port** for a general protocol; itâ€™s just the default chosen by GlassFish.
    

ðŸ‘‰ If you see **port 4848 open** on a host, it usually means a **GlassFish or Payara server** (Payara is a GlassFish fork) is running, and the admin interface may be exposed.
