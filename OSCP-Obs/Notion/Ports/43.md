# WHOIS

**`Default Port: 43`**

**WHOIS**Â is a query and response protocol that is widely used for querying databases to determine the registrant or assignee of Internet resources, such as a domain name, an IP address block, or an autonomous system.

By using the WHOIS protocol, you can gather an extensive amount of information regarding a target.

- Domain owner
- Domain Registrar
- Name Servers
- Creation Date
- Expiration Date
- Last Updated
- State and Country etc.

## Enumeration

You can gather a substantial amount of information using the WHOIS protocol.

```
whois hackviser.com
```

Python's python-whois library offers a simple way to communicate with the WHOIS protocol:

```
import whoisw = whois.whois('hackviser.com')print(w)print(w.status)print(w.name)print(w.org)print(w.address)
```

## Attack Vectors

Even though WHOIS itself doesn't have any direct vulnerabilities, It can inadvertently lead to security breach by leaking sensitive information.

### Information Leakage

Basic reconnaissance and data gathering might allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information like contact information, addresses, registered domains, and many more.

```
whois example.com
```

### Domain Expiration

An attacker could deny the service by waiting for the domain to expire and then registering the domain for themselves.

```
whois example.com | grep "Expiry Date"
```
