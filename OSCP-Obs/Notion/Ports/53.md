**DNS (Domain Name System)**Â functions as the internet's phonebook, converting user-friendly domain names like hackviser.com into numerical IP addresses, enabling swift access to online resources. DNS is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It translates human-readable domain names to numerical IP addresses, essential for locating and identifying computer services and devices within network protocols.
