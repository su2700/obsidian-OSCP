# Kerberos

**`Default Port: 88`**

Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that works on the basis of "tickets" to allow nodes to prove their identity over a non-secure network in a secure manner. Kerberos provides mutual authenticationâ€”both the user and the server verify each other's identity.
