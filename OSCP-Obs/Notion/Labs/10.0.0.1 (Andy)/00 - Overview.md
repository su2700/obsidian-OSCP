## Box Outline

Box outlines are useful for revisiting the box and seeing how you exploited it. They may help you find practical examples of exploits, or trigger you to think about what you could improve

**Enumeration**

What services are running on the box? How did you enumerate them?

**Exploitation**

What exploits did you try? Which ones worked?

**Privilege Escalation**

What user did you gain access on the box as? What did you find during local enumeration? How did you escalate your privileges?

**Post Exploitation**

Any useful information found on the machine.

## Timeline

You can use this section to track when you started and finished this machine, including when you gained a 'foothold' (low-privilege shell) on the box and began privilege escalation. Knowing how long it took can help to judge how long a machine may take on the exam.
