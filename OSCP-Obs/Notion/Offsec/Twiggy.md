I see that we're having connectivity issues with the SaltStack repository, and the system package installation approach isn't working. Let's try a different approach using Python virtual environment:

1. First, create and activate a new virtual environment:

```Plain
python -m venv salt-env
```

```Plain
source salt-env/bin/activate
```

1. Install the required packages using pip:

```Plain
pip install salt PyYAML
```

1. After the installation completes, run your script while the virtual environment is active:

```Plain
python CVE-2020-11652.py
```

This approach should work better because:

- It isolates the dependencies from your system Python
- It doesn't require system-wide package installation
- It can install packages directly from PyPI without needing the SaltStack repository
- It will automatically handle all the necessary dependencies  
    If you want to deactivate the virtual environment later, you can simply run:

```Plain
deactivate
```
