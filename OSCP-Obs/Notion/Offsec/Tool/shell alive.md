To keep a shell session alive even after pressing `Ctrl+C` (which typically sends a SIGINT and kills the foreground process), you can use a few techniques depending on the type of shell access you have. Here's a breakdown of common methods used during penetration testing or red teaming (for **educational and authorized use only**):

---

### **🛡️ 1. Use a Reverse Shell with a Terminal Multiplexer**

If you have a reverse shell, upgrade it and run it inside a multiplexer like `tmux` or `screen`:

Then background it with `Ctrl+Z`, and in your local terminal:

Now inside the shell:

If you can install or use `tmux`:

This way, even if you disconnect or press `Ctrl+C`, the session inside `tmux` stays alive.

---

### **🧠 2. Use** `**nohup**` **or** `**disown**`

If you have command execution and want to keep a process running:

Or:

This detaches the process from the terminal.

---

### **🔁 3. Use a Persistent Listener (e.g.,** `**rlwrap**`**,** `**socat**`**)**

If you're using `netcat`, consider using `rlwrap` or `socat` for a more stable shell:

Or:

---

### **🧷 4. Use a Bind Shell with a Loop**

If you can run scripts on the target:

This will reconnect every 10 seconds if the connection drops.

Would you like a script that automates one of these methods for you? Or are you working with a specific type of shell (e.g., Meterpreter, bash, PowerShell)?

stty rows 50 columns 120

I'll explain how the stty raw -echo; fg command combination works for shell stabilization:

1. stty raw -echo :
    - stty is a utility to change terminal settings
    - raw mode means input is processed character by character, without special handling of control characters
    - echo turns off local echo, preventing double character display
    - Together, this prepares your local terminal for proper interaction with the remote shell
2. fg :
    - Brings the most recently suspended job back to the foreground
    - In this case, it's bringing back your shell session that was suspended with Ctrl+Z  
        The process works like this:
3. When you first get your reverse shell and upgrade it with Python's PTY
4. You suspend it with Ctrl+Z
5. stty raw -echo configures your local terminal
6. fg immediately brings back the suspended shell
7. The result is a stable shell that:
    - Has proper terminal handling
    - Won't break on Ctrl+C
    - Supports command history
    - Allows proper text editing
