how to find default cred:




Got it 👍 — let’s break down what you’re seeing in that screenshot.

You ran this command in **Kali Linux**:

`grep -r 'Sonatype Nexus'`

inside the directory:

`/usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Passwords`

---

### 🧩 What this does

- `grep -r` = recursively search for text inside files.
    
- `'Sonatype Nexus'` = the search term.
    
- `/usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Passwords` = directory containing **SecLists**, a well-known collection of default passwords, usernames, etc.
    

So you’re looking for **default credentials** related to _Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager_.
